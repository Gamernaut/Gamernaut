## Who am I?
I'm a hobbyist programmer who has been away from programming for many years and is starting to get back into it now. I'm completely self taught (having started with BASIC in the 80s) and devour anything I can find in books, on the web or in other peoples code to increase my knowledge. I'm currently learning/relearning C++ and Python and will probably add Kotlin, PHP and Javascript to my list eventually.<BR>

## What am I interested in?
I have 2 main areas of interest. The first is the use of Data Science (AI & ML and more advanced techniques such as Genetic Algorithms) to solve biological scientific problems. Secondly I'd love to build some kind of Space/Flight simulator, which I see as an ongoing lifetime project. I'm not under any illusions that this will be HARD and take a LONG TIME but if I don't try I won't stretch myself and can't improve.<BR>

## What am I looking for?
Like minded souls. Anyone who is keen to share their expereince with implementing code for either of my areas of interest above. I'm looking to learn and to contribute to some open source projects but have never worked in a software development team so would love to gain expereince in that.<BR><BR>
